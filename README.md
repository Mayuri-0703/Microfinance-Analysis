# Microfinance-Analysis
Microfinance Analysis is a system that predicts loan eligibility and amounts for small businesses based on 52 weeks of transaction data. Users upload a CSV file, and the system uses machine learning models to evaluate loan eligibility and predict loan amounts. The project is built with Python Flask for the backend and MySQL for data storage.
